Coding Challenege Description 

Look up 5 websites/apps where Pulsd events can be reposted e.g. eventbrite.com. Write code
to automate this syndication process.
The end product should have an admin panel to add new events/products to database and in
the backend there should be a process e.g. cron job, ruby worker etc which checks database for
new entries at a given interval, say once every hour, and in case of new entries, takes all new
data and syndicates it to all the 5 websites that you looked up earlier.
You may create any tables (such as products etc.) and fields (such as product_name,
product_description, product_price etc.) in database as per requirement.

● Make assumptions as needed.

● Write down all the assumptions you make in your final report.

● You may use any programming languages and tools.

● You have 48 hours to submit your project after receiving this email.

● Git repository is preferred method to submit project but not necessary.

● You may use any hosting, e.g. free tier on AWS etc, to host your project for demo if
needed.
