in the face of great odds.", "but for all the progress that has been made, we must surely acknowledge that neither kenya nor the african continent have yet fulfilled their potential - that the hopefulness of the post-colonial era has been replaced by cynicism and sometimes despair, and that true freedom has not yet been won for those struggling to live on less than a few shillings a day, for those who have fallen prey to hiv/aids or malaria, to those ordinary citizens who continue to find themselves trapped in the crossfire of war or ethnic conflict.", "in early 1960's, as kenya was gaining its independence, its gross national product was not very different from that of south korea.", "today, south korea's economy is forty times larger than kenya's.", "certainly it is not due to

the question is what strategies, imperfect though they may be, are most likely to achieve the best outcome in iraq, one that will ultimately put us on a more effective course to deal with international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and other critical threats to our security.", "what is absolutely clear is that it is not enough for the president to respond to iraq\u2019s reality by

without question.", "they have battled insurgents, secured cities, and maintained some semblance of order in iraq.", "i have long said that the only solution in iraq is a political one.", "to reach such a solution, we must communicate clearly and effectively to the factions in iraq that the days of asking, urging, and waiting for them to take control of their own country are coming to an end.",

six months.", "for only through this phased redeployment can we send a clear message to the iraqi factions that the u.s. is not going to hold together this country indefinitely ?", "that it will be up

u.s. forces.", "when possible, this should be done in consultation with the iraqi government ?", "but it should not depend on iraqi approval.", "the redeployment could be temporarily suspended if the parties in iraq reach an effective political arrangement that stabilizes the situation and they offer us a clear and compelling rationale for maintaining certain troop levels.", "drawing down our troops in iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to northern iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.", "this force could help prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in northern iraq, reassure allies in the gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.", "the president\u2019s decision to go to war in iraq has had disastrous consequences for afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.", "by redeploying from iraq to afghanistan, we will answer nato\u2019s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.", "as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.", "in such a scenario, it is conceivable that a significantly reduced u.s. force might remain in iraq for a more extended period of time.", "but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ?", "we would make clear in such a scenario that the united states would not be maintaining permanent military bases in iraq, but would do what was necessary to help prevent a total collapse of the iraqi state and further polarization of iraqi society.", "the second part of our strategy should be to couple this phased redeployment with a more effective plan that puts the iraqi security forces in the lead, intensifies and focuses our efforts to train those forces, and expands the numbers of our personnel ?", "who are deployed with iraqi as units advisers.", "an increase in the quality and quantity of u.s. personnel in training and advisory roles can guard against militia infiltration of iraqi units; develop the trust and goodwill of iraqi soldiers and the local populace; and lead to better intelligence while undercutting grassroots support for the insurgents.", "any u.s. strategy must address the problem of sectarian militias in iraq.", "in the absence of a genuine commitment on the part of all of the factions in iraq to deal with this issue, it is doubtful that a unified iraqi government can function for long, and it is doubtful that u.s. forces, no matter how large, can prevent an escalation of widespread sectarian killing.", "of course, in order to convince the various factions to embark on the admittedly difficult task of disarming their militias, the iraqi government must also make headway on reforming the institutions that support the military and the police.", "we can teach the soldiers to fight and police to patrol, but if the iraqi government will not properly feed, adequately pay, or provide them with the equipment they need, they will continue to desert in large numbers, or maintain fealty only to their religious group rather than the national government.", "the third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.", "so far, congress has given the administration unprecedented flexibility in determining how to spend more than $20 billion dollars in iraq.", "today, the iraqi landscape is littered with ill-conceived, half-finished projects that have done almost nothing to help the iraqi people or stabilize the country.", "we need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.", "but we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.", "finally, we have to realize that the entire middle east has an enormous stake in the outcome of iraq, and we must engage neighboring countries in finding a solution.", "but neither iran nor syria want to see a security vacuum in iraq filled with chaos, terrorism, refugees, and violence, as it could have a destabilizing effect throughout the entire region ?", "and so i firmly believe that we should convene a regional conference with the iraqis, saudis, iranians, syrians, the turks, jordanians, the british and others.", "the goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various iraqi factions towards a political solution.", "if the iranians and syrians think they can use iraq as another afghanistan or a staging area from which to attack israel or other countries, they are badly mistaken.", "as we change

original decision to go to war in iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.", "much has been written about how the military invasion of iraq was planned without any thought to what political situation we would find after baghdad fell.", "threats we haven\u2019t paid nearly enough attention to because we have been distracted in iraq.", "the national intelligence estimate, which details how we\u2019re creating more terrorists in iraq than we\u2019re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.",

world.", "there is one other place where our mistakes in iraq have cost us dearly ?", "but to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there ?", "i spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about iraq that was similar to the one i did today.", "the time for waiting in iraq is over.", "it is time to

imminent threat to the united states; that a war in iraq would harm, not help, our efforts to defeat al qaeda and finish the job in afghanistan; and that an invasion would require an occupation of undetermined length, at undetermined cost, with undetermined consequences.", "month after month, and then year after year, i\u2019ve watched with a heavy heart as my deepest suspicions about this war\u2019s conception have been confirmed and exacerbated in its disastrous implementation.", "when i came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, i suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of american troops from iraqi soil.", "a year in which well-respected republicans like john warner, former administration officials like colin powell, generals who have served in iraq, and intelligence experts have all said that what we are doing is not working.", "according to our own pentagon, the situation on the ground is now pointing towards chaos.", "and i believe that it remains possible to salvage an acceptable outcome to this long and misguided war.", "for the fact is that there are no good options left in this war.", "and it is not enough for the president to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of american resolve.", "and, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.", "moreover, without a coherent strategy or better cooperation from the iraqis, we would only be putting more of our soldiers in the crossfire of a civil war.", "but even as they have carried out their responsibilities with excellence and valor, they have also told me that there is no military solution to this war.", "to pressure the iraqi leadership to finally come to a political agreement between the warring factions that can create some sense of stability in the country and bring this conflict under control.", "this force could help prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in northern iraq, reassure allies in the gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.", "the president\u2019s decision to go to war in iraq has had disastrous consequences for afghanistan -- we have seen a fierce taliban offensive, a spike in terrorist attacks, and a narcotrafficking problem spiral out of control.", "instead of consolidating the gains made by the karzai government, we are backsliding towards chaos.", "but only if u.s. commanders think such a force would be effective; if there is substantial movement towards a political solution among iraqi factions; if the iraqi government showed a serious commitment to disbanding the militias; and if the iraqi government asked us ?", "the third part of our strategy should be to link continued economic aid in iraq with the existence of tangible progress toward a political settlement.", "this must end in the next session of congress, when we reassert our authority to oversee the management of this war.", "but we need to also move towards more condition-based aid packages where economic assistance is contingent upon the ability of iraqis to make measurable progress on reducing sectarian violence and forging a lasting political settlement.", "the goal of this conference should be to get foreign fighters out of iraq, prevent a further descent into civil war, and push the various iraqi factions towards a political solution.", "many who supported the original decision to go to war in iraq have argued that it has been a failure of implementation.", "that the rationale behind the war itself was misguided.", "and so going forward, i believe there are strategic lessons to be learned from this as we continue to confront the new threats of this new century.", "the second lesson is that in any conflict, it is not enough to simply plan for war; you must also plan for success.", "the national intelligence estimate, which details how we\u2019re creating more terrorists in iraq than we\u2019re defeating, is the most obvious example of how the war is hurting our efforts in the larger battle against terrorism.", "throughout american history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom.", "in each case, what has been required to meet the challenges we face has been good judgment and clear vision from our leaders, and a fundamental seriousness and engagement on the part of the american people ?", "a few tuesdays ago, the american people embraced this seriousness with regards to america\u2019s policy in iraq.", "americans were originally persuaded by the president to go to war in part because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction, and in part because they were told that it would help reduce the threat of international terrorism.", "and now, after three long years of watching the same back and forth in washington, the american people have sent a clear message that the days of using the war on terror as a political football are over.", "the american people have determined that all these phrases have become meaningless in the face of a conflict that grows more deadly and chaotic with each passing day ?", "2,867 americans have now died in this war.", "iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before american troops arrived.", "these are serious times for our country, and with their votes two weeks ago, americans demanded a feasible strategy with defined goals in iraq ?", "when i came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, i suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of american troops from iraqi soil.", "300,000 iraqi security forces have supposedly been recruited and trained over the last two years, and yet american troop levels have not been reduced by a single soldier.", "the addition of 4,000 american troops in baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.", "and polls show that almost two-thirds of all iraqis now sympathize with attacks on american soldiers.", "\u201crejected the notion of an american \u2018timeline\u2019 for action on urgent iraqi political issues; ordered american commanders to lift checkpoints they had set up around the shiite district of sadr city to hunt for a kidnapped american soldier and a fugitive shiite death squad leader; and blamed the americans for the deteriorating security situation in iraq.\u201d\nthis is now the reality of iraq.", "and it is not enough for the president to tell us that victory in this war is simply a matter of american resolve.", "the american people have been extraordinarily resolved.", "it\u2019s not clear that these troop levels are sustainable for a significant period of time, and according to our commanders on the ground, adding american forces will only relieve the iraqis from doing more on their own.", "the american soldiers i met when i traveled to iraq this year were performing their duties with bravery, with brilliance, and without question.", "moreover, it could be suspended if at any point u.s. commanders believe that a further reduction would put american troops in danger.", "as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.", "but instead of effectively targeting this aid, we have seen some of the largest waste, fraud, and abuse of foreign aid in american history.", "and that is the loss of our government\u2019s credibility with the american people.", "according to a pew survey, 42% of americans now agree with the statement that the u.s. should \"mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.\u201d\nwe cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now.", "americans called for this more serious policy a few tuesdays ago.", "iraq is descending into chaos based on ethnic divisions that were around long before american troops arrived.", "when i came here and gave a speech on this war a year ago, i suggested that we begin to move towards a phased redeployment of american troops from iraqi soil.", "the addition of 4,000 american troops in baghdad has not succeeded in securing that increasingly perilous city.", "namely, preventing iraq from becoming what afghanistan once was, maintaining our influence in the middle east, and forging a political settlement to stop the sectarian violence so that our troops can come home.", "and, while some have proposed escalating this war by adding thousands of more troops, there is little reason to believe that this will achieve these results either.", "our troops can help suppress the violence, but they cannot solve its root causes.", "and all the troops in the world won\u2019t be able to force shia, sunni, and kurd to sit down at a table, resolve their differences, and forge a lasting peace.", "a phased redeployment of u.s. troops from iraq on a timetable that would begin in four to six months.", "we cannot compromise the safety of our troops, and we should be willing to adjust to realities on the ground.", "moreover, it could be suspended if at any point u.s. commanders believe that a further reduction would put american troops in danger.", "drawing down our troops in iraq will allow us to redeploy additional troops to northern iraq and elsewhere in the region as an over-the-horizon force.", "this force could help prevent the conflict in iraq from becoming a wider war, consolidate gains in northern iraq, reassure allies in the gulf, allow our troops to strike directly at al qaeda wherever it may exist, and demonstrate to international terrorist organizations that they have not driven us from the region.", "perhaps most importantly, some of these troops could be redeployed to afghanistan, where our lack of focus and commitment of resources has led to an increasing deterioration of the security situation there.", "by redeploying from iraq to afghanistan, we will answer nato\u2019s call for more troops and provide a much-needed boost to this critical fight against terrorism.", "as a phased redeployment is executed, the majority of the u.s. troops remaining in iraq should be dedicated to the critical, but less visible roles, of protecting logistics supply points, critical infrastructure, and american enclaves like the green zone, as well as acting as a rapid reaction force to respond to emergencies and go after terrorists.", "we need to continue to provide some basic reconstruction funding that will be used to put iraqis to work and help our troops stabilize key areas.", "if we commit our troops anywhere in the world, it is our solemn responsibility to define their mission and formulate a viable plan to fulfill that mission and bring our troops home.", "the overwhelming presence of our troops, our intelligence, and our resources in iraq has stretched our military to the breaking point and distracted us from the growing threats of a dangerous world.", "as some of you know, senator lugar and i recently traveled to russia, ukraine, and azerbaijan to witness firsthand both the progress we're making in securing the world's most dangerous weapons, as well as the serious challenges that lie ahead.", "this is a city of two and a half million, and in a non-descript building right in the middle of town stood this facility that once operated on the fringes of the soviet biological weapons program.", "of course, dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the cooperative threat reduction programs he co-founded with senator sam nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former soviet union after the cold war.", "but this is one story that shows our job is far from finished at a time when demand for these weapons has never been greater.", "and as we speak, members of al qaeda and other terrorists organizations are aggressively pursuing weapons of mass destruction, which they would use without hesitation.", "we've heard the horror stories - attempts by rogue states to recruit former soviet weapons scientists; terrorists shopping for weapons grade materials on the black market.", "some weapons experts believe that terrorists are likely to find enough fissile material to build a bomb in the next ten years - and we can imagine with horror what the world will be like if they succeed.", "and that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former soviet union represent the greatest threat to the security of the united states - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.", "fortunately, the success of cooperative threat reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.", "in a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.", "i want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs.", "but because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.", "my third recommendation - which i'll just touch briefly on and let senator lugar talk about in more detail - is that we need to start thinking creatively about some of the next-generation efforts on nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.", "on our trip, we saw two areas where this is possible: elimination of heavy conventional weapons, and interdiction efforts to help stop the flow of dangerous materials across borders.", "in donetsk, i stood among piles of conventional weapons that were slowly being dismantled.", "while the government of ukraine is making progress here, the limited funding they have means that at the current pace, it will take sixty years to dismantle these weapons.", "but we've all seen how it could take far less time for these weapons to leak out and travel around the world, fueling insurgencies and violent conflicts from africa to afghanistan.", "but when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the u.s.-russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.", "we must safeguard these dangerous weapons, material, and expertise.", "now, few people understand these challenges better than the co-founder of the cooperative threat reduction program, dick lugar, and this is something that became particularly clear to me during one incident on the trip.", "of course, dick has been there and he has done that, and thanks to the cooperative threat reduction programs he co-founded with senator sam nunn, we've made amazing progress in finding, securing, and guarding some of the deadliest weapons that were left scattered throughout the former soviet union after the cold war.", "and that is why the nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons within the borders of the former soviet union represent the greatest threat to the security of the united states - a threat we need to think seriously and intelligently about in the months to come.", "fortunately, the success of cooperative threat reduction - especially in securing nuclear weapons - serves as a model of how we can do this.", "with the situation in russia and the rest of the former soviet union so drastically different than it was in 1991, or even in 1996 or 2001, what must we do to effectively confront this threat in the days and years to come?", "first, the nunn-lugar program should be more engaged in containing proliferation threats from soviet-supplied, civilian research reactors throughout russia and the independent states.", "yet, a serious threat still remains.", "in a way that balances the needs of science and security, more needs to be done to bring these materials - as well as other sources that can be used to construct improvised nuclear weapons and radiological devices -- under control and dramatically reduce the proliferation threat they pose.", "i want to turn to a second critical area: biological weapons threat reduction programs.", "and the kiev story is heading in the right direction - while we were in ukraine, dick, through his tireless and personal intervention, was able to achieve a breakthrough with that government, bringing that facility and others under the cooperative threat reduction program.", "but because of the size, secrecy, and scope of the soviet biological weapons program, we are still dangerously behind in dealing with this proliferation threat.", "we need to be sure that nunn-lugar is increasingly focused on these very real non-proliferation and bioterrorism threats.", "one of the most important steps is for russia to permit the access and transparency necessary to deal with the threat.", "as the avian influenza outbreak demonstrates, even the zealous russian border guard is helpless against the global sweep of biological threats.", "but when we think about the threat that these weapons pose to our global security, we cannot allow the u.s.-russian relationship to deteriorate to the point where russia does not think it's in their best interest to help us finish the job we started.", "one way we could strengthen this relationship is by thinking about the russians as more of a partner and less of a subordinate in the cooperative threat reduction effort.", "we also need to ensure that the cooperative threat reduction umbrella agreement, due to expire in 2006, is renewed in a timely manner.", "and we need to work together to obtain a bilateral agreement on biological threat reduction.", "but, when i think about what is at stake i am reminded by a quote from the late president kennedy given in a speech at american university in 1963 about threats posed by the soviet union."]}}
